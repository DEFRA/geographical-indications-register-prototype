   "details": "\n<p>Recent research from Public Health England (PHE) shows that people that experience flooding in their homes can suffer from mental health illnesses, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. This has an economic impact, including costs to the health service and lost days at work.</p>\n\n<p>This project developed a method for evaluating the impact of flooding on mental health, and assessing\nthese economic impacts. Prior to this study, the economic case for flood defence schemes and strategies focused on the physical damage of flooding on properties or businesses. This new approach will allow the benefits of avoiding negative impacts on mental health to be considered in the main economic business case when selecting preferred options and applying for flood risk investment.</p>",

The focus of this project was on flooding from rivers, although surface water and groundwater were also considered. Options to improve coastal flood forecasting are considered in the joint Defra/Environment Agency R&amp;D project Investigating Coastal Flood Forecasting (SC140007).</p>\n\n<p>The Environment Agency’s National Flood Forecasting System (NFFS) supports flood incident management by forecasting river flow and level at specific locations. This project examines how maps could be linked to flood forecasts generated by the NFFS.</p>\n",

   "details": "\n<p>The Environment Agency has developed a new guide on the assessment and management of blockage. Drawing on the latest research and international good practice, it provides guidance on screening for blockage risk, quantifying the risk of blockage and choosing a management approach.</p>\n\n<p>The blockage of watercourses or structures by debris (such as man-made materials, vegetation or sediment) reduces flow capacity and raises water levels. Although well-managed blockages in the right place can reduce flood risk and restore natural processes, blockage in the wrong place can increase the risk of flooding, structural failure or embankment breach. It can also change flow patterns, causing scour and undermining structures, obstructing navigation and presenting a hazard to water users.</p>\n\n<p>The appropriate management of blockage is essential to manage these risks. In recent years, environmental legislation has emphasised the need to work with natural processes, promoting a move towards more sustainable practices. The consistent economic appraisal of blockage is also necessary to allow the preparation of a business case for the full range of management measures from maintenance to capital works.</p>\n",
